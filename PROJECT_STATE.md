## Recently Completed (2026-03-27) — Scan Reliability + Regime Scoring Removal

### yf.download() Timeout Fix
- **`scripts/yf_session.py`** — 60-second thread-based timeout on every `yf.download()` call. Hangs now return empty DataFrame instead of blocking entire 200-ticker batch indefinitely. Asymmetric Catalyst Hunters was timing out at 879-1587s before this fix.

### Delisted Ticker Cleanup
- **`data/curated_universe.json`** — removed 26 dead tickers across two passes (ALE, JBT, DNKN, AMRS, SGEN, USM, MSGN, MSG, LGF.A, ASTR, BPMC, DCPH, KRTX, BHLB, ESGR, EXPR, SKX, BRY, AIMC, AIRC, PGRE, PNM, SJW, GCP, SUM, WOW, SQ). These were causing yfinance error handling stalls that chained into scan timeouts.

### Discovery Scan Isolation
- **`scripts/stock_discovery.py`** — each scan type (momentum_breakouts, oversold_bounces, sector_leaders, volume_anomalies) is now wrapped in its own try/except. One failing scan no longer kills the others. Added `"Close" not in df.columns` guard in breakout and oversold loops.

### Regime Scoring Removed
- **`scripts/stock_scorer.py`** — `_load_weights()` always returns `default_weights`; `get_min_score_threshold()` returns flat float. Regime logic entirely removed.
- **`scripts/factor_learning.py`** — weight lookup uses only `default_weights`; regime branch removed.
- **All 14 portfolio `config.json` files** — removed `regime_weights` blocks; replaced dict `min_score_threshold` with flat `35.0`.
- Rationale (first-principles drill): composite score already reflects regime through real-time factors. Regime weights on stale quarterly data (quality/earnings) added noise. Threshold gate was shutting down discovery on single red days.

### ETF Holdings Limits Expanded
- **`scripts/etf_holdings_provider.py`** — bumped `max_holdings` across all DEFAULT_ETFS to get broader universe: IWM/IJR/VB→200, SPY→500, QQQ→100, sector ETFs→75, XBI→100.

### YOLO Degen Momentum Fixes
- Switched ETF list to broad market: `[IWM, QQQ, SPY, ARKK, XBI, KWEB, IGV, BUZZ, IJR, VB]`
- Set scan_frequency to `daily` on extended tier
- Rewrote strategy DNA with proper maximum-aggression description

### New Portfolios Added
- `microcap-momentum-compounder` — focused microcap momentum
- `yolo-degen-momentum` — maximum aggression, 2 positions at 50% each

## Recently Completed (2026-03-26) — VCX Same-Run Reentry Veto + Stop Floor

### Same-Run Reentry Veto
- **`scripts/unified_analysis.py`** — after Layer 4 sequencing, vetoes any BUY where the ticker is also being SOLD in the same run AND `buy_price >= avg_cost_basis`. Cost-basis-lowering rebuys (buy below current avg) are still allowed through.
- Prevents the `SELL VCX @ $X / BUY VCX @ $X` no-op trade cycle on high-volatility concentrated positions.

### min_stop_loss_pct Floor
- **`scripts/risk_layer.py`** — added `min_stop_loss_pct` floor: if `config["enhanced_trading"]["min_stop_loss_pct"]` is set, the recommended stop can never exceed `entry_price * (1 + min_stop_loss_pct)`. Prevents stops from being set unreasonably tight for high-volatility strategies.
- **`data/portfolios/vcx-ai-concentration/config.json`** — `"min_stop_loss_pct": -0.35` (-35% floor). VCX DNA says not to sell on volatility; -35% floor gives room for normal pre-IPO swings while still protecting against genuine breakdown.
- All 91 tests passing.

## Recently Completed (2026-03-26) — Reentry Guard

### Reentry Guard
- **`scripts/reentry_guard.py`** (new) — `get_reentry_context()` + `_format_reentry_block()`. Zero trading-module imports. Reads `transactions.csv`, finds most recent SELL within configurable lookback window, computes factor delta from most recent BUY entry scores vs current scores.
- **Configurable stop-loss cooldown** — hardcoded `timedelta(days=7)` in `opportunity_layer.py` now reads `stop_loss_cooldown_days` from `config["enhanced_trading"]["reentry_guard"]`
- **Mechanical path injection** — `OpportunityLayer` attaches `reentry_context` to each `BuyProposal`; `unified_analysis.py` forwards it to `ProposedAction`; `ai_review.py` injects formatted block into prompt for BUY actions
- **AI-driven path injection** — `_run_ai_driven_analysis()` in `unified_analysis.py` calls `get_reentry_context()` in the `scored_candidates` loop; `ai_allocator.py` injects block in both `full_watchlist` and standard rendering branches
- **DNA-driven config for new portfolios** — `strategy_generator.py` extended to infer `reentry_guard` values from portfolio DNA; `portfolio_registry.py` applies them at creation time
- **Per-portfolio config** under `enhanced_trading.reentry_guard`: `enabled`, `stop_loss_cooldown_days` (default 7), `lookback_days` (default 30), `meaningful_change_threshold_pts` (default 10)
- 18 tests in `tests/test_reentry_guard.py` all passing
- Existing portfolios use defaults silently — no config migration needed

## Recently Completed (2026-03-26) — System Logs Page

### System Logs Page (`/logs` route)
- New `LOGS` button in TopBar (between VIX/regime area and CLOSE ALL) — toggles back to overview on re-click
- `LogsPage.tsx` — 3 sections: Today's Briefing (Claude narrative), Pipeline Grid (14-day), Event Timeline (collapsible per day)
- `api/routes/system.py` — `GET /api/system/logs` (30-day summaries) + `GET /api/system/narrative` (Claude daily briefing, 10-min cache, `?regenerate=true` bypass)
- `scripts/log_parser.py` — parses `cron/logs/` files: scan/execute (regex summary line), update (line counting), watchdog (restart events), + trade counts from `transactions.csv`
- 10 tests in `tests/test_log_parser.py` all passing
- All portfolio hooks (`usePortfolioState`, `useRisk`, `usePerformance`) gated to skip when `activePortfolioId === "logs"`

---

## Previously Completed (2026-03-26)

### Prompt Context Enrichment
5 new context blocks now sent to Claude during the execute/allocate phase:
- **PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE** — win rate, avg win/loss, benchmark comparison (from `analytics.py`)
- **ACTIVE ALERTS** — early warning alerts on held positions forwarded from `early_warning.py`
- **FACTOR INTELLIGENCE** — which factors have been most predictive (from `factor_learning.py`)
- **Position age** — days held per position injected into prompt extras
- **Cash idle time** — how long uninvested cash has been sitting
- Built in `_run_ai_driven_analysis()` via `prompt_extras` dict → `_build_allocation_prompt()`

### FactorLearner Date Parsing Fix
- `pd.to_datetime(df["date"])` was crashing on mixed formats (`2026-03-25` vs `2026-03-25T16:07:12`)
- Fix: `format="mixed"` parameter in `factor_learning.py`

### DISABLE_SOCIAL Env Var
- Added guard in `unified_analysis.py` and `watchlist_manager.py`: skip social enrichment if `DISABLE_SOCIAL` is set
- Baked into `run_dashboard.sh`: `DISABLE_SOCIAL=true uvicorn ...`
- All cron scripts export `DISABLE_SOCIAL=true`
- Reason: Stocktwits 403 errors + 10–30 extra API calls per scan → timeout

### Cron Automation
- 4 scripts in `cron/`: `scan.sh`, `execute.sh`, `update.sh`, `api_watchdog.sh`
- Crontab installed with 6 entries:
  - 6:30 AM ET Mon–Fri: `scan.sh` (pre-market watchlist refresh)
  - 9:35 AM ET Mon–Fri: `execute.sh` (AI analyze + execute all portfolios)
  - 12:00 PM ET Mon–Fri: `update.sh` (mid-day P&L)
  - 4:15 PM ET Mon–Fri: `update.sh` (post-close snapshot + factor learning)
  - Every 15 min: `api_watchdog.sh` (restart API if down)
  - Sunday midnight: log cleanup (delete logs > 30 days)
- Tests: `tests/test_cron_scripts.py` — 6 tests all passing
- Logs: `cron/logs/` (gitignored)

### Watchlist Fixes
- microcap `max_tickers` lowered 300→200
- `_remove_zero_score_tickers()` added — grace-period cleanup for stale zero-score tickers
- Zero-score ETF seeds demoted CORE→ETF_HOLDINGS (no longer protected from removal)
- Stale window shortened 60→30 days

### Public.com Cross-Validation
- UPDATE now always fetches both public.com AND yfinance
- Divergence >15% → use yfinance close, log override
- Fixes stale OTC prices (VCX was showing $459 vs actual $380) and `day_change=$0` bug

### ETF Holdings Cache
- Moved from per-portfolio to single global `data/etf_holdings_cache.json`

### New Portfolios (2026-03-26)
- `asymmetric-microcap-compounder` — microcap, AI-driven, $1K→$10K, max 2 positions, 45% risk/trade
- `vcx-ai-concentration` — TBD strategy DNA, needs configuration

---

## Previously Completed (2026-03-25)

- Alpha scoring per position (`unrealized_pnl_pct − benchmark_return_since_entry`)
- Trade timestamps (ISO datetime, not date-only)
- Market hours ET fix (pre-market $0 day P&L bug)
- Null filter crash fix (`max_market_cap_m: null` → `float("inf")`)
- Execute 500 error fix (dataclass serialization via `serialize()` + `_normalize_reviewed_action()`)
- Duplicate AI reasoning fix in DetailCard
- 4 new portfolios: cash-cow-compounders, asymmetric-catalyst-hunters, catalyst-momentum-scalper, momentum-scalper
- CSV writes atomic (`.tmp` + `Path.replace()`)
- `_last_analysis` persisted to disk (survives API restarts)

---

## Previously Completed (2026-03-23)

- Portfolio setup redesign — AI-driven-only 2-step creation modal
- `suggest_config_for_dna()` in `strategy_generator.py`
- Hardened AI-driven creation defaults

---

## Open Bugs / Known Issues

- `ALE`, `JBT` tickers delisted — fail price fetch consistently (ignore)
- `vcx-ai-concentration` — strategy DNA configured; has min_stop_loss_pct=-0.35 and reentry_guard set. Needs initial scan to populate watchlist.
- New portfolios (asymmetric-microcap-compounder, vcx-ai-concentration) need initial scans to populate watchlists
- Stocktwits returning 403s broadly — social heat won't populate (external issue, DISABLE_SOCIAL workaround in place)
- No tests for `_validate_allocation()` / `_parse_json()` in `ai_allocator.py`
- `layer1_output` param unused in `_run_ai_driven_analysis()`

## Architecture Decisions

- **Alpha = position_return_pct − benchmark_return_since_entry** — per-position, computed at state load
- **DISABLE_SOCIAL=true** — always set; social enrichment too unreliable/slow for production use
- **Scan timing**: 6:30 AM (not 7:30 AM) — needs 3-hour buffer before 9:35 AM execute for cold cache worst case
- **Watchdog health check**: substring match `[[ "$HEALTH" == *'"status":"ok"'* ]]` — more robust than exact string match
- `extended_max` capped at 3000 for AI-driven portfolios with `rotating_3day`
- `accept` conviction multiplier = 1.0 (not 0.75 — 0.75 creates a dead zone)
- Dashboard API on port 8001 (conflict avoidance with exitwise on 8000)
- ETF holdings cache is global: `data/etf_holdings_cache.json` (not per-portfolio)
- **Regime weights removed from scoring** (2026-03-27) — composite score already reflects regime through real-time momentum/RSI/volume. Stale quality/earnings weights were adding noise. Flat default_weights + flat threshold (35.0) for all portfolios.
- **yf.download() 60s timeout** — thread-based, in `yf_session.py`. Empty DataFrame returned on timeout; scan continues with next batch.

---

## Key Constraints

- Python 3 only (`python3` not `python`)
- Paper mode — no real broker, all trades are CSV writes
- Never pass `session=` to yfinance — breaks with curl_cffi
- `react-resizable-panels` v4: use `Group`, `Panel`, `Separator`
- Sector-specific AI portfolios need CURATED_CORE watchlist entries (scan alone won't find large-caps)

---
